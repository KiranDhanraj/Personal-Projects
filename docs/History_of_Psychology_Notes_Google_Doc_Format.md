# History of Psychology

## Roadblocks to Psychology:
- Dualism: the idea that a human consists as body and soul which are separate from each other. The soul controls behaviour and thinking.

## The Scope of Modern Psychology
- Basic Processes → How the mind works
- Development → Origins of the mind
- Individual differences
- Pathology → Disorders of mental life 
- Extreme personality such as extreme extroversion and introversion 
- Application of basic knowledge → Education, therapy, work

## Psychology is a Science of Behaviour 
Psychology explains behaviour via mental causation.

It is a level of abstraction above biophysical explanations of behaviour (such as hormones and neurotransmissions).
Some problems that psychology addresses is how memory works

Psychology also addresses social situations:
- Competition and Coperation in groups
- Social Influence
- Yerkes Dodson Law: how social pressure affects performance
- Social Cognition

It also looks at biology:
- Neuroscience
- Body systems such as hormones
- What role genetics plays on behavioral patterns
- Nature vs Nurture

## Psychology as a Physical Science:
- The brain is electrochemical
- Psychophysics: Physical stimuli affect psychological state
- Brain measurement and imaging : MRI,s 

## Cognitive Science: 
- Multidisciplinary

## Research Methods

Doing psychology experiments is difficult because people are more random and uncontrolled compared to other subjects.
Psychology averages evidence across a large sample size
Theory Testing
Exploratory Research: done when no theory is made yet and a bunch of data is gathered in an expiriment. With this information gathered, we can make a theory.
Case studies: extreme examples that can give insight. Cannot really be used for making general claims since it's only one person.
Observation
Self report

### Theory Testing: Test cause and effect relationship between variables and outcomes

Theory: an idea designed to organize and explain existing facts and be able to predict outcomes in future experiments.

Empirical research: Theory testing
Design experiments that can falsify your theory

Hypotheses are testable predictions, generated from a theory
Research Hypotheses: what you think will happen
Null Hypotheses: the opposite is true, there’s no relationship at all

### Experimental research: 
Extraneous variables, confounds combatted by random assignment. Ensure no other variables impact result.

Different research design
- Within-subjects: the same subjects are subjected to different conditions: for example, the same group that fasts the day before the test will later not eat before the test
- Between-subjects: different groups subjected to different conditions

Within-subject experiments often reveal the experiment question to the subjects which could impact behaviour

#### Demand Characteristics: when the subject understands the hypothesis and the desired outcome and acts differently because of it

#### Ways to reduce bias: 
- Single blind study; participants don’t know which treatment
- Double blind study, Neither participant nor experimenter knows exact treatment

Institutional review board (IRB) protects participation
Minimize stress to participants

## Neuropsychology

- Temporal Lobe: sound, memory
- Frontal Lobe: Critical thinking, Personality, Emotion regulation
- Occiptial: vision
- Parietal: sensory coretesx: temperature, taste, 

Its a myth that we only use 10 percent of our brain. Originates from Wilder penfield who found that stimulating a part of the brain didn’t have any noticeable impact.People believe in it because it suggests untapped potential

### Lesion Studies

Pierre Paul Broca had two patients (case studies) with head injuries that resulted in them being unable to speak while still understanding language. 
After they died he looked at their brains and found the part of the brain responsible for understanding language which is called Broca’s area.
Broca’s aphasia is the name for the condition where people have difficulties with speech.

Wernicke worked with patients who could produce speech but not understand it. He discovered Wernicke's area which is responsible for this.
Wernicke’s aphasia is a condition where the Wernicke's area is damaged leading to lack of speech understanding.

HM:
Patient who had hippocampus removed 
Unable to form new memories

Phineas Gage:

Damaged frontal lobe led to lack of emotional regulation

Lesion Studies can only happen by luck

### Animal Research 
Single-cell recording studies: electrodes placed directly into the brain.

Drug studies in Canada must first be done on animals.

#### Example: Brain on Alcohol
Rats were given alcohol and had the choice to voluntarily exercise.
Exercise  helped prevent cell death after binge-drinking 

### TMS Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: temporarily suppresses a part of the brain.
rTMS (rapid TMS) is used to treat depression: Tms is placed on the left frontal cortex, which is underactive in some patients with depression. 
Minimal side effects

### EEG: Measures patterns of electrical activity
Measure’s through scalp
Doesn’t provide any spatial detail: doesn’t tell you what part of the brain is doing what
Used for detecting epilepsy, examining sleep disorders
Detecting concussions

Personality Prediciton in Babies: Grumpy babies that have a lot of activity happening in the right frontal lobe have higher social anxiety at age 4

#### Event related potentials:
Using an EEG to measure brain response to a particular stimuli
Reveals reaction time

#### Oddball paradigm:
Show recurring stimuli but have something out of place
Resposnse after target is amplified if it is improbable or extremely out of place.

### Magnetic resonance Imagine (MRI):
Brain Scan

### fMRI: measures blood flow and gives a real time picture of what’s going on

### Reasearch question on test:
Make a study to answer a question.
Things to include:
Correlation or Experimental?
Independent and Dependent Variables
Inferential statistics

## Sensation and Perception
We’re designed to detect change
Stimulation Threshold: at what point can they detect a threshold better than random chance

Difference threshold 
( Just noticeable threshold) the minimum difference in magnitude between two stimuli to notice

Weber’s law:
What we notice is based on proportion: if the difference is greater than 1/30th of the previous level humans notice
For example: a person won’t notice if you add 1 gram to a hand holding 90 grams, but they will if you add 3 grams.

The purpose of perception:
Neurons are specialized for detection different individual features such as edges orienataiotn, colour, and movement.

Circumscription entails that we detect the form surrounding the other form as the ground. We focus on the foreground.

Grouping: we organize stimuli into coherent group

### Multisensory Perception:
People combine senses when processing the world
Visual Dominance: when we get competing information from senses we trust our vision.

### Speech Perception:
To process speech we must hear sounds, but seeing the mouth is more helpful.

## Developmental Psychology

### Ainsworth Strange Situation: a test created by researchers to measure mother daughter bond. 
- Initial mother-child interaction
- Mother leaves baby alone
- Friendly stranger enters room
- Mother returns

Scoring:
- Desire for baby to maintain contact
- Resistant behaviour
- Proximity (whether baby comes closer) 
- Avoidant behaviour

Forms of Attachment:
- Secure: High on contact  and proximity
- Insecure Avoidant: High on resistant and avoidance
- InsecureL Anxious resistance: wants to be close but is also resistant

Infant Father attachment: 
Stay at home dads are increasing in frequency

### Diana Baumrind Parenting Dimensions:
Parental responsiveness
How in tune and interested a parent is in their child
Too much responsiveness would be a parent who does anything the kid asks. 
On the other end of the spectrum, the parent doesn't care what their child wants
Parental demandingness
How much the parent expects of their child

Based on the dimensions there are 4 parenting styles

Indulgent Permissive: Low on demandingness and high on responsiveness (spoiling their child): 
doesn’t make their kid earn anything and gives them whatever they want

Indifferent Uninvolved: Low on demandingness and Low on responsiveness 

Authoritarian: Low on responsiveness, high on demandingness:
Demands a lot from their children but doesn’t care about what they want.
Forces their child to go down a path the child doesn’t choose

Authoritative: High on responsiveness, high on demandingness:
Demands a lot from their children and pushes them to achieve their goals
Makes them earn rewards.

### Transitioning to Adolescence (Teen Years)
Parents play a large role, but peer influences become very important.
Identity formation
Identity moratorium (Indulgent-permissive): prolonged experimentation 
Identity foreclosure (authoritarian parenting): no exploration, but committed
Identity diffusion (indifferent uninvolved parenting) : refusal to commit and lack of interest 
Identity achievement (authoritative): considered many, stuck to one

## Perspectives on Cognitive Development

Piaget: Child as a scientist
Mental development through experimentation
Develop scheme

Vygotsky: child as apprentice
Emphasized the social environment: child learns from teaching 

-zone of proximal development” not too hard not too easy for child

Information processing
Change in mental machinery
Memory development

### Jean Piaget
Father of Cognitive Development

Two processes of knowledge acquisition
Assimilation: modifying and adding incoming info

Accomodation: altering or creating structures

Equilibrium: everything makes sense according to the knowledge the child has
Dis-equilibrium: when new information is presented that is contrary to the child’s knowledge. The child then reacts with Assimilation or Accomodation.

Assimilation is like blowing up a balloon: adding info
Accommodation is like making a balloon animal from a balloon

#### 4 stages of development:
Sensiromotor Stage; infants thinking and exploration based on immediate sensory and motor experiences
Sensorimotor schemes: banging, hitting, sucking
Milestones: Piaget believed they would exit this stage when they develop object permanence
In reality infants have object permanence as early as 3 months but they cant execute actions that show their knowledge.

Preoperational  Stage (2-7 years)
Characterized by understanding symbols, pretend play, and mastery of conservation
Use objects symbolically: eg. pretend a pencil is a sword
Major Milestones
Scale Error ( around 3 years): 3 year old tries to get into a tiny small car. Doesn’t understand size.
Master conservation (by the end): understand that quantity/amount is not related to physical appearance  (1 litre of water in a tall glass is the same as 1 liter of water in a wide glass)
	
Concrete Operational Stage ( 7-11) 
Children develop skills in manipulating numbers, as well as logical thinking
Can’t think about hypothetical
Reversibility
Transistivity: if a>b and b>c then a>c

Formal Operational Stage 11+
Abstract and hypothetical thinking
Metacongition, introspection and self-reflection

### Emerging Reasearch
Windows into infant’s mind:
Babies are good at looking, touching, kicking, and sucking.
Researches found that babies recongize the language their mother spoke in utero because they suck harder when

## Learning processes

### Classical Conditioning Phenomena. 
Pavloved trained dogs with conditioning ( associate rining bell with food)
Pavlov attaches a neutral stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus like food that elicits an unconditioned response ( salivation). After repeated association, rhe neutral stimulus becomes the conditioned stimulus and leads to the conditioned response( salivation).

Drug Tolerance: 
Generalization 
- stimuli that resemble the conditioned stimulus will elicit the response

### Operant conditioningL skinner thorndike
Consequences
Positive and negative reinforcement  (negative reinforcement: taking away bad stimuli)
Positive and negative punishment

Reinforcement schedule 
Fixed: 
Interval : reinforce a response after a set amount of time has elapsed
Reinforce a response after a set number of responses occur
Variable: 
Interval : reinforce a response around but not at the same time
Reinforce: around a but not after the same number of responses
Variable conditioning lasts for much longer and won’t break if reinforcement isn’t on a strict schedule. 
Fixed Schedule

### The Cognitive Revolotion: pushback to behaviourism.
Memory:

Two types of Sensory Memory:
Iconic memory: vision
Echoic: sound

Obligotory Processing:
You automatically read words that you see: stroop effect 

One on parenting
- on on theory of mind development

## Social Psychology
Personality Psychology:
Look at Personal Factors to determine behaviour
Use correlational methods
Social psychologists change situations and see how 
Use experimental methods

Social Psychologists look at scenarios that are so impactful that most people react the same way.
Conformity
Conformity: A change in behaviour to fit in with a group
Social norms: Guidelines for how to behave
